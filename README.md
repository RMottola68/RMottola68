Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I'm Ryan!

A former chef based in New York, now a fullstack software engineer. I love expanding my repertoire of programming languages and I genuinely believe nobody is done learning.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on breaking into the software engineering industry
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about web development and live streaming
- âš¡ Fun fact: I consult with new streamers to setup audio and video encoding
